# Polynomial Invariant of Stuck Knots

## Installation

cd stuquandles
```

You must have Python 3 installed on your system to run the programs in this repository.

## 1. Try a stuquandle on the links

In the file `links.py`, make tables that represent * operation (op), R1, R2, R3, R4. Then, run
```bash
python3 links.py
```
In the output, you will see the counting invariant, the colorings, whether they are the same for both links, and the substuquandle polynomials.
